    abstract = {CNS disorders, and in particular psychiatric illnesses, lack definitive disease-altering therapeutics. The limited understanding of the mechanisms driving these illnesses with the slow pace and high cost of drug development exacerbates this issue. For these reasons, drug repurposing – both a less expensive and time-efficient practice compared to de novo drug development – has been a promising strategy to overcome the paucity of treatments available for these debilitating disorders. While empirical drug-repurposing has been a routine practice in clinical psychiatry, innovative, informed, and cost-effective repurposing efforts using big data ("omics") have been designed to characterize drugs by structural and transcriptomic signatures. These strategies, in conjunction with ontological integration, provide an important opportunity to address knowledge-based challenges associated with drug development for CNS disorders. In this review, we discuss various signature-based in silico approaches to drug repurposing, its integration with multiple omics platforms, and how this data can be used for clinically relevant, evidence-based drug repurposing. These tools provide an exciting translational avenue to merge omics-based drug discovery platforms with patient-specific disease signatures, ultimately facilitating the identification of new therapies for numerous psychiatric disorders.},

    abstract = {The treatment of CNS disorders, and in particular psychiatric illnesses, lacks disease-altering therapeutics for many conditions. This is likely due to regulatory challenges involving the high cost and slow-pace of drug development for CNS disorders as well as due to limited understanding of disease causality. Repurposing drugs for new indications have lower cost and shorter development timeline compared to that of de novo drug development. Historically, empirical drug-repurposing is a standard practice in psychiatry; however, recent advances in characterizing molecules with their structural and transcriptomic signatures along with ensemble of data analysis approaches, provides informed and cost-effective repurposing strategies that ameliorate the regulatory challenges. In addition, the potential to incorporate ontological approaches along with signature-based repurposing techniques addresses the various knowledge-based challenges associated with CNS drug development. In this review we primarily discuss signature-based in silico approaches to drug repurposing, and its integration with data science platforms for evidence-based drug repurposing. We contrast various in silico and empirical approaches and discuss possible avenues to improve the clinical relevance. These concepts provide a promising new translational avenue for developing new therapies for difficult to treat disorders, and offer the possibility of connecting drug discovery platforms and big data analytics with personalized disease signatures.

Identification of effective therapeutics is a crucial tool to treat those infected with SARS-CoV-2 and limit the spread of this novel disease globally. We deployed a bioinformatics workflow to identify candidate drugs for the treatment of COVID-19. Using an "omics" repository, the Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS), we simultaneously probed transcriptomic signatures of putative COVID-19 drugs and publicly available SARS-CoV-2 infected cell lines to identify novel therapeutics. We identified a shortlist of 20 candidate drugs: 8 are already under trial for the treatment of COVID-19, the remaining 12 have antiviral properties and 6 have antiviral efficacy against coronaviruses specifically, in vitro. All candidate drugs are either FDA approved or are under investigation. Our candidate drug findings are discordant with (i.e., reverse) SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome signatures generated in vitro, and a subset are also identified in transcriptome signatures generated from COVID-19 patient samples, like the MEK inhibitor selumetinib. Overall, our findings provide additional support for drugs that are already being explored as therapeutic agents for the treatment of COVID-19 and identify promising novel targets that are worthy of further investigation.},

    abstract = {The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a worldwide pandemic, infecting over 16 million people worldwide with a significant mortality rate. However, there is no current Food and Drug Administration-approved drug that treats coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Damage to T lymphocytes along with the cytokine storm are important factors that lead to exacerbation of clinical cases. Here, we are proposing intravenous oxytocin (OXT) as a candidate for adjunctive therapy for COVID-19. OXT has anti-inflammatory and proimmune adaptive functions. Using the Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS), we used the transcriptomic signature for carbetocin, an OXT agonist, and compared it to gene knockdown signatures of inflammatory (such as interleukin IL-1β and IL-6) and proimmune markers (including T cell and macrophage cell markers like CD40 and ARG1). We found that carbetocin's transcriptomic signature has a pattern of concordance with inflammation and immune marker knockdown signatures that are consistent with reduction of inflammation and promotion and sustaining of immune response. This suggests that carbetocin may have potent effects in modulating inflammation, attenuating T cell inhibition, and enhancing T cell activation. Our results also suggest that carbetocin is more effective at inducing immune cell responses than either lopinavir or hydroxychloroquine, both of which have been explored for the treatment of COVID-19.},

    abstract = {Kinase drug discovery represents an active area of therapeutic research, with previous pharmaceutical success improving patient outcomes across a wide variety of human diseases. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), innovative pharmaceutical strategies such as kinase targeting have been unable to appreciably increase patient survival. This may be due, in part, to unchecked desmoplastic reactions to pancreatic tumors. Desmoplastic stroma enhances tumor development and progression while simultaneously restricting drug delivery to the tumor cells it protects. Emerging evidence indicates that many of the pathologic fibrotic processes directly or indirectly supporting desmoplasia may be driven by targetable protein tyrosine kinases such as Fyn-related kinase (FRK); B lymphoid kinase (BLK); hemopoietic cell kinase (HCK); ABL proto-oncogene 2 kinase (ABL2); discoidin domain receptor 1 kinase (DDR1); Lck/Yes-related novel kinase (LYN); ephrin receptor A8 kinase (EPHA8); FYN proto-oncogene kinase (FYN); lymphocyte cell-specific kinase (LCK); tec protein kinase (TEC). Herein, we review literature related to these kinases and posit signaling networks, mechanisms, and biochemical relationships by which this group may contribute to PDAC tumor growth and desmoplasia.},

    abstract = {Pancreatic cancer remains one of the most difficult malignancies to treat. Minimal improvements in patient outcomes and persistently abysmal patient survival rates underscore the great need for new treatment strategies. Currently, there is intense interest in therapeutic strategies that target tyrosine protein kinases. Here, we employed kinome arrays and bioinformatic pipelines capable of identifying differentially active protein tyrosine kinases in different patient-derived pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cell lines and wild-type pancreatic tissue to investigate the unique kinomic networks of PDAC samples and posit novel target kinases for pancreatic cancer therapy. Consistent with previously described reports, the resultant peptide-based kinome array profiles identified increased protein tyrosine kinase activity in pancreatic cancer for the following kinases: epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), fms related receptor tyrosine kinase 4/vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (FLT4/VEGFR-3), insulin receptor (INSR), ephrin receptor A2 (EPHA2), platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA), SRC proto-oncogene kinase (SRC), and tyrosine kinase non receptor 2 (TNK2). Furthermore, this study identified increased activity for protein tyrosine kinases with limited prior evidence of differential activity in pancreatic cancer. These protein tyrosine kinases include B lymphoid kinase (BLK), Fyn-related kinase (FRK), Lck/Yes-related novel kinase (LYN), FYN proto-oncogene kinase (FYN), lymphocyte cell-specific kinase (LCK), tec protein kinase (TEC), hemopoietic cell kinase (HCK), ABL proto-oncogene 2 kinase (ABL2), discoidin domain receptor 1 kinase (DDR1), and ephrin receptor A8 kinase (EPHA8). Together, these results support the utility of peptide array kinomic analyses in the generation of potential candidate kinases for future pancreatic cancer therapeutic development.},

Using COVID-19 as a case study, we discuss examples of machine-learning and signature-based approaches that have been adapted to rapidly identify candidate drugs.

Next, we discuss how these recent advances in bioinformatic drug repurposing approaches might be adapted to identify repurposable drugs for CNS disorders. As the development of novel therapies that successfully target the cause of neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders has stalled, there is a pressing need for innovative strategies to treat these complex brain disorders.

While quantitative measurements of transcripts and proteins are key to investigate the state of a biological system, they do not inform the "active" state of regulatory networks. In consideration of that fact, "functional" proteomics assessments are needed to decipher active regulatory processes. Phosphorylation, a key post-translation modification, is a reversible regulatory mechanism that controls the functional state of proteins. Recent advancements of high-throughput protein kinase activity profiling platforms allow for a broad assessment of protein kinase networks in complex biological systems. In conjunction with sophisticated computational modeling techniques, these profiling platforms provide datasets that inform the active state of regulatory systems in disease models and highlight potential drug targets. Taken together, system-wide profiling of protein kinase activity has become a critical component of modern molecular biology research and presents a promising avenue for drug discovery.},

Cytokine storm in patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) drives this pattern of poor clinical outcomes and is dependent upon the activity of the transcription factor complex nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappaB) and its downstream target gene interleukin 6 (IL6) which interacts with IL6 receptor (IL6R) and the IL6 signal transduction protein (IL6ST or gp130) to regulate intracellular inflammatory pathways. In this study, we compare transcriptomic signatures from a variety of drug-treated or genetically suppressed (i.e. knockdown) cell lines in order to identify a mechanism by which antidepressants such as fluoxetine demonstrate non-serotonergic, anti-inflammatory effects. Our results demonstrate a critical role for IL6ST and NF-kappaB Subunit 1 (NFKB1) in fluoxetine's ability to act as a potential therapy for hyperinflammatory states such as asthma, sepsis, and COVID-19.},

Sex differences in the prevalence and presentation of psychiatric disorders, and the association of a psychiatric diagnosis with increased risk of suicide, are well-established. However, the neurobiology underlying these features of disease are not well understood. Dysfunction of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), a brain region responsible for decision-making and sensory processing, has been implicated in psychiatric disorders but remains understudied compared to other frontocortical brain regions.
\&nbsp;In this study we investigated sexual dimorphism in psychiatric illnesses and suicide by analyzing publicly available OFC transcriptional profiles (RNAseq data obtained from the Stanley Neuropathology Consortium) from individuals with SCZ, BPD, MDD, and non-psychiatric controls (n=15/group). \&nbsp;
Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed significant differences in immune-related processes in male and female comparisons and in psychiatric disorders relative to controls. Analysis of top differentially expressed genes found changes in P2RY12 in males and females who died by suicide. Additionally, downregulation of protein folding processes was observed in female suicide subjects, suggesting an association between dysregulated protein metabolism and suicide. Our results further our understanding of the shared and unique molecular pathways underlying psychiatric disorders and suicide.

    abstract = {Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) are a category of pervasive disorders of the developing nervous system with few or no recognized biomarkers. A significant portion of the risk for NDDs, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), is contributed by the environment, and exposure to pyrethroid pesticides during pregnancy has been identified as a potential risk factor for NDD in the unborn child. We recently showed that low-dose developmental exposure to the pyrethroid pesticide deltamethrin in mice causes male-biased changes to ADHD- and NDD-relevant behaviors as well as the striatal dopamine system. Here, we used an integrated multiomics approach to determine the broadest possible set of biological changes in the mouse brain caused by developmental pyrethroid exposure (DPE). Using a litter-based, split-sample design, we exposed mouse dams during pregnancy and lactation to deltamethrin (3 mg/kg or vehicle every 3 days) at a concentration well below the EPA-determined benchmark dose used for regulatory guidance. We raised male offspring to adulthood, euthanized them, and pulverized and divided whole brain samples for split-sample transcriptomics, kinomics and multiomics integration. Transcriptome analysis revealed alterations to multiple canonical clock genes, and kinome analysis revealed changes in the activity of multiple kinases involved in synaptic plasticity, including the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase ERK. Multiomics integration revealed a dysregulated protein-protein interaction network containing primary clusters for MAP kinase cascades, regulation of apoptosis, and synaptic function. These results demonstrate that DPE causes a multi-modal biophenotype in the brain relevant to ADHD and identifies new potential mechanisms of action.},

    abstract = {Astrocytes have many important functions in the brain, but their roles in psychiatric disorders and their responses to psychotropic medications are still being elucidated. Here, we used gene enrichment analysis to assess the relationships between different astrocyte subtypes, psychiatric diseases, and psychotropic medications (antipsychotics, antidepressants and mood stabilizers). We also carried out qPCR analyses and "look-up" studies to assess the chronic effects of these drugs on astrocyte marker gene expression. Our bioinformatic analysis identified gene enrichment of different astrocyte subtypes in psychiatric disorders. The highest level of enrichment was found in schizophrenia, supporting a role for astrocytes in this disorder. We also found differential enrichment of astrocyte subtypes associated with specific biological processes, highlighting the complex responses of astrocytes under pathological conditions. Enrichment of protein phosphorylation in astrocytes and disease was confirmed by biochemical analysis. Analysis of LINCS chemical perturbagen gene signatures also found that kinase inhibitors were highly discordant with astrocyte-SCZ associated gene signatures. However, we found that common gene enrichment of different psychotropic medications and astrocyte subtypes was limited. These results were confirmed by "look-up" studies and qPCR analysis, which also reported little effect of psychotropic medications on common astrocyte marker gene expression, suggesting that astrocytes are not a primary target of these medications. Conversely, antipsychotic medication does affect astrocyte gene marker expression in postmortem schizophrenia brain tissue, supporting specific astrocyte responses in different pathological conditions. Overall, this study provides a unique view of astrocyte subtypes and the effect of medications on astrocytes in disease, which will contribute to our understanding of their role in psychiatric disorders and offers insights into targeting astrocytes therapeutically.},

    abstract = {Protein kinases and their substrates form signaling networks partitioned across subcellular compartments to facilitate critical biological processes. While the subcellular roles of many individual kinases have been elucidated, a comprehensive assessment of the synaptic subkinome is lacking. Further, most studies of kinases focus on transcript, protein, and/or phospho-protein expression levels, providing an indirect measure of protein kinase activity. Prior work suggests that gene expression levels are not a good predictor of protein function. Thus, we assessed global serine/threonine protein kinase activity profiles in synaptosomal, nuclear, and cytosolic fractions from rat frontal cortex homogenate using peptide arrays. Comparisons made between fractions demonstrated differences in overall protein kinase activity. Upstream kinase analysis revealed a list of cognate kinases that were enriched in the synaptosomal fraction compared to the nuclear fraction. We identified many kinases in the synaptic fraction previously implicated in this compartment, while also identifying other kinases with little or no evidence for synaptic localization. Our results show the feasibility of assessing subcellular fractions with peptide activity arrays, as well as suggesting compartment specific activity profiles associated with established and novel kinases.},

    abstract = {Social dominance is essential for maintaining a stable society and has both positive and negative impacts on social animals, including humans. However, the  regulatory mechanisms governing social dominance, as well as the crucial  regulators and biomarkers involved, remain poorly understood. We discover that  mice lacking acid-sensing ion channel 2 (ASIC2) exhibit persistently higher  social dominance than their wild-type cagemates. Conversely, overexpression of  ASIC2 in the medial prefrontal cortex reverses the dominance hierarchy observed  in ASIC2 knockout (Asic2(-/-)) mice. Asic2(-/-) neurons exhibit increased  synaptic transmission and plasticity, potentially mediated by protein kinase A  signaling pathway. Furthermore, ASIC2 plays distinct functional roles in  excitatory and inhibitory neurons, thereby modulating the balance of neuronal  activities underlying social dominance behaviors-a phenomenon suggestive of a  cell subtype-specific mechanism. This research lays the groundwork for  understanding the mechanisms of social dominance, offering potential insights for  managing social disorders, such as depression and anxiety.},

    abstract = {Schizophrenia is characterized by substantial alterations in brain function, and previous studies suggest insulin signaling pathways, particularly involving AKT,  are implicated in the pathophysiology of the disorder. This study demonstrates  elevated mRNA expression of AKT1-3 in neurons from schizophrenia subjects,  contrary to unchanged or diminished total AKT protein expression reported in  previous postmortem studies, suggesting a potential decoupling of transcript and  protein levels. Sex-specific differential AKT activity was observed, indicating  divergent roles in males and females with schizophrenia. Alongside AKT,  upregulation of PDPK1, a critical component of the insulin signaling pathway, and  several protein phosphatases known to regulate AKT were detected. Moreover,  enhanced expression of the transcription factor FOXO1, a regulator of glucose  metabolism, hints at possible compensatory mechanisms related to insulin  signaling dysregulation. Findings were largely independent of antipsychotic  medication use, suggesting inherent alterations in schizophrenia. These results  highlight the significance of AKT and related signaling pathways in  schizophrenia, proposing that these changes might represent a compensatory  response to a primary defect of canonical insulin signaling pathways. This  research underscores the need for a detailed understanding of these signaling  pathways for the development of effective therapeutic strategies.},

In order to improve the understanding of molecular  physiology of metastatic uveal melanoma, we identified genes and pathways  implicated in metastatic vs non-metastatic uveal melanoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS:  A previously published dataset from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) was used to  identify differentially expressed genes between metastatic and non-metastatic  samples as well as to conduct pathway and perturbagen analyses using Gene Set  Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), EnrichR, and iLINCS. RESULTS: In male metastatic  uveal melanoma samples, the gene LOC401052 is significantly down-regulated and  FHDC1 is significantly up-regulated compared to non-metastatic male samples. In  female samples, no significant differently expressed genes were found.  Additionally, we identified many significant up-regulated immune response  pathways in male metastatic uveal melanoma, including "T cell activation in  immune response". In contrast, many top up-regulated female pathways involve iron  metabolism, including "heme biosynthetic process". iLINCS perturbagen analysis  identified that both male and female samples have similar discordant activity  with growth factor receptors, but only female samples have discordant activity  with progesterone receptor agonists. CONCLUSION: Our results from analyzing  genes, pathways, and perturbagens demonstrate differences in metastatic processes  between sexes.},

    abstract = {Regular exercise confers numerous physical and mental health benefits, yet individual variability in exercise participation and outcomes is still poorly understood. Uncovering the neurobiological mechanisms governing exercise behavior is essential for promoting physical activity and developing targeted interventions for related disorders. While genetic studies have provided insights, they often cannot account for protein-level alterations, such as changes in kinase activity. Here, we employ protein kinase activity profiling to delineate brain protein kinase activity and signaling networks modulated by acute voluntary exercise in rats. Focusing on the dorsal striatum, which governs voluntary exercise, as well as the hippocampus, which is susceptible to modulation by physical activity, we aim to understand the molecular basis of exercise behavior. Utilizing high throughput kinome array profiling and advanced pathway analyses, we identified protein kinase signaling pathways implicated in regulating voluntary exercise. Pathway analysis using Gene Ontology (GO) revealed significant alterations in 155 GO terms in the dorsal striatum and 206 GO terms in the hippocampus. Changes in kinase activity were observed in the striatum and hippocampus between the exercise (voluntary wheel running, VWR) and sedentary control rats. In both regions, global serine-threonine kinase (STK) activity was decreased, while global phospho-tyrosine kinase (PTK) activity was increased in VWR rats compared to control rats. We also identified specific kinases altered in VWR rats, including the IKappaB Kinase (IKK) and protein kinase delta (PKD) families. C-terminal src Kinase (CSK), epidermal growth factor (EGFR), and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) tyrosine kinase were also enriched. These findings suggest regional heterogeneity of kinase activity following voluntary exercise, emphasizing potential molecular mechanisms underlying exercise behavior. This exploratory study lays the groundwork for future investigations into the causality of variations in exercise outcomes among individuals and different sexes, as well as the development of targeted interventions to promote physical activity and combat associated chronic diseases.},

    abstract = {High throughput functional kinome analysis using PamChip has significantly advanced our understanding of functional proteomics and Kinomics. However, the diversity in methods that analyze the resulting dataset has meant that we are forced to either pick one or undergo painful procedures to integrate the results across multiple methods. To address these issues, we introduce the Kinome Analysis Description Language (KADL), a unified Domain Specific Language (DSL) for analyzing the kinome data.

KADL is expressed as a subset of the English language that allows for a declarative description of the analysis results that can then be displayed either as an R Shiny application, a PDF document, or as individual figures that can be integrated directly into a manuscript. The description conforms to a Parsing Expression Grammar (PEG) representation that maps the description into precise steps, which can then be executed to generate the results. Rust, a memory- and type-safe language, is used to translate the KADL representation into distinct analysis steps in R. The R representation then generates the final analysis results. It integrates established tools such as Upstream Kinase Analysis (UKA), Kinome Random Sampling Analyzer (KRSA), Kinase Enrichment Analysis (KEA3), and PTM Substrate Enrichment Analysis (PTM-SEA).
KADL offers a comprehensive high throughput kinome analysis platform, supporting multiple visualizations and providing a user-friendly syntax. The combination of Rust and R contributes to its efficiency, accuracy, and adaptability. The language addresses methodological disparities, streamlining the analysis workflow and fostering reproducibility.
In conclusion, the Kinome Analysis Description Language (KADL) represents a significant advancement in high throughput kinome analysis. Its integration of tools, user-friendly syntax, and utilization of PEG parsers, Rust, and R contribute to standardization, efficiency, and the generation of robust results. KADL stands as a powerful tool poised to catalyze advancements in kinome research.},

    abstract = {Abstract          Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a complex psychiatric disorder with unclear biological mechanisms. Spectrins, cytoskeletal proteins linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, are regulated by the AKT/GSK3 pathway, which is implicated in SCZ. However, the impact of SCZ-related dysregulation of this pathway on spectrin expression and distribution remains unexplored. Here, we show that βIV spectrin protein levels were reduced in neurons of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in SCZ postmortem samples compared to healthy control (HC) from the Human Brain Collection Core (HBCC). To investigate potential links between βIV spectrin and the AKT/GSK3 pathway, we analyzed the PsychEncode dataset, revealing elevated SPTBN4 and AKT2 mRNA levels with correlated gene transcription in both HCs and individuals with SCZ. Next, computational tools were employed to identify potential AKT and GSK3 phosphorylation sites on βIV spectrin, and two GSK3 sites were validated through in vitro assays. To assess whether βIV spectrin distribution and sensitivity to AKT/GSK3 are altered in SCZ, we used iPSC-derived neurons from two independent cohorts of patients with significantly increased familial genetic risk for the disorder. Alteration in βIV spectrin levels and sensitivity to AKT/GSK3 inhibitors were consistently observed across both cohorts. Importantly, a Random Forest classifier applied to βIV spectrin imaging achieved up to 98\% accuracy in classifying cells by diagnosis in postmortem samples, and by diagnosis or diagnosis × perturbation in iPSC samples. These findings reveal altered βIV spectrin levels and AKT/GSK3 sensitivity in SCZ, identifying βIV spectrin image-based endophenotypes as robust, generalizable predictive biomarkers of SCZ, with the potential for scalable clinical applications.},

However, understanding differences in kinase signaling of brain cells remains a preeminent challenge of neuroscience. This study aimed to characterize kinase pathways enriched in astrocytes and microglia isolated from male and female murine prefrontal cortex. Using the PamGene PamStation®12 platform, we discovered cell-type-specific kinomic profiles and computationally reconstructed each cell type's unique active signaling protein-protein interaction network. Notably, our analysis revealed minimal overlap between kinase activity and respective cell-subtype specific kinase transcriptional profiles identified in the Allen Mouse Whole Brain Transcriptomic Cell Type Atlas, highlighting an important limitation of relying solely on gene mRNA expression levels for functional inference in kinase focused studies. These findings also suggest that cell- and sex-specific protein kinase signaling may influence susceptibility to deleterious brain conditions and consequently underscore the importance of considering activity as a biological variable in systems research, offering a new framework for developing targeted therapeutic interventions in precision medicine.},

    abstract = {Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) are a category of pervasive disorders of the developing nervous system with few or no recognized biomarkers. A significant portion of the risk for NDDs, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), is contributed by the environment, and exposure to pyrethroid pesticides during pregnancy has been identified as a potential risk factor for NDD in the unborn child. We recently showed that low-dose developmental exposure to the pyrethroid pesticide deltamethrin in mice causes male-biased changes to ADHD- and NDD-relevant behaviors as well as the striatal dopamine system. Here, we used an integrated multiomics approach to determine the broadest possible set of biological changes in the mouse brain caused by developmental pyrethroid exposure (DPE). Using a litter-based, split-sample design, we exposed mouse dams during pregnancy and lactation to deltamethrin (3 mg/kg or vehicle every 3 days) at a concentration well below the EPA-determined benchmark dose used for regulatory guidance. We raised male offspring to adulthood, euthanized them, and pulverized and divided whole brain samples for split-sample transcriptomics, kinomics and multiomics integration. Transcriptome analysis revealed alterations to multiple canonical clock genes, and kinome analysis revealed changes in the activity of multiple kinases involved in synaptic plasticity, including the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase ERK. Multiomics integration revealed a dysregulated protein-protein interaction network containing primary clusters for MAP kinase cascades, regulation of apoptosis, and synaptic function. These results demonstrate that DPE causes a multi-modal biophenotype in the brain relevant to ADHD and identifies new potential mechanisms of action.},
