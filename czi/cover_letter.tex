I have been fascinated and awed by the effective and time-critical work CZI
has been doing and enabling. The values of your organization resonate with
how I approach my place as a scientist and a researcher. That is why I was excited
to see the position for \textbf{Senior Computational Biologist}.
Over the past eight years, I have worked at the
intersection of \textbf{human biology, machine learning, and computational tool
    development}, not just chasing answers, but empowering others to do the same.

At the University of Toledo's Cognitive Disorders Research Lab, I have led
projects analyzing large-scale \textbf{kinomic, single-cell, proteomic, and
    transcriptomic} datasets to uncover mechanisms in schizophrenia, cancer, and
COVID-19. I developed reproducible computational workflows that reduced
analysis time by more than half and deployed them on AWS infrastructure used
by over 50 researchers. Through these efforts, I have co-authored \textbf{more
    than 25 peer-reviewed publications} spanning kinase signaling,
psychiatric genomics, and drug repurposing.

A hallmark of my work has been building open-source software that directly
supports the broader research community. My R package \textbf{drugfindR}
enables high-throughput drug repurposing analyses and has been submitted to
Bioconductor, while my Rust application \textbf{Variant Forge} provides a
high-performance platform for protein sequence comparisons via REST API. These
tools exemplify my commitment to creating scalable, accessible, and
scientifically rigorous products â€” a goal that aligns closely with CZI's
vision of embedding computational biology into usable platforms for the
scientific community.

Beyond technical expertise, I bring a strong record of \textbf{cross-disciplinary
    collaboration and mentorship}. I supervised a schizophrenia research team,
comprising undergraduate students, research technicians and junior graduate student peers
producing eight publications, directed the lab's AWS-based compute
infrastructure, and founded the Association of Bioinformaticists and Computational
Biologists to build a community of practice at my university. I have also
taught bioinformatics workshops and designed computational curricula for medical
students, experience that has honed my ability to \textbf{translate complex
    computational approaches for diverse audiences}.

I am particularly inspired by CZI's grand challenges, especially the development
of AI-based virtual cell models and new frameworks for multimodal human
datasets. My background in both human disease biology and machine learning
applications positions me to contribute meaningfully to these initiatives, from
prototyping workflows to ensuring their biological validity and community
adoption.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my expertise and passions align
with CZI's mission to accelerate discovery and transform the future of
human health. Thank you for your time and consideration.
